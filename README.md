## About
<b>Charms Bar Port</b> is the brand new solution for bringing back the Windows 8.x Charms bar to Windows 10 and Windows 11, using real files from Windows 8.x to meet your cravings and enhance your desktop.

Forked from <a href="https://github.com/Jerhynh/CharmsBarRevived">Charms Bar Revived</a>, <b>Charms Bar Port</b> will assist on helping you transition to Windows 10 and 11 without having to keep on the obsolete system forever.

## How does it work?
On touch screens, swipe from the right edge towards to bring up the Charms bar. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Windows key + C, just like it was on Windows 8.x. The menu icons function exactly like ValiNet's Charms, which went offline not too long ago.

## Features
* Powered by Visual Studio 2022
* <!--Ported-->Based on Windows 8.1 Update 3
* Includes accent colors!
